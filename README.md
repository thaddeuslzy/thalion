# Thalion
Thalion was my first web development project over my Year 1 Summer, while I was busy raising a $100k for FLAG and planning BASH for School of Computing. 

## About
I chose the context as my local church community as they had a website with rather bad design, and I wanted to design a webpage that would be an improvement over the old one. I didnt have the time to finish this project as my Year 1 Summer was just too busy, but I learnt a great deal about HTML, CSS, and I deployed this website on heroku for awhile.
